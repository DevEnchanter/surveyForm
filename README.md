Mars Survey Form
This project involves a survey form designed to gather feedback and suggestions about potential Mars exploration missions. The form is developed as an interactive web page, allowing users to input their responses and submit them for analysis.

The Mars Survey Form is a user-friendly tool, developed with the aim of gaining insights and understanding about public opinion on Mars exploration. The form is designed with multiple fields to gather various types of user data including basic personal information, occupational details, views on Mars exploration, and specific areas of interest or concern regarding Mars missions.

The form is structured with a variety of input types including text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown selections. This ensures that the data is gathered in an organized manner, allowing for efficient analysis and interpretation.

The layout of the form has been designed with a focus on user convenience and aesthetic appeal. The form fields are arranged neatly to ensure ease of use and readability. The page is also styled with a Mars-themed background image, and a dark overlay to provide contrast for the white text and form fields.

The form is built using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. HTML5 semantic elements are used to enhance the accessibility and SEO of the page. CSS3 features are utilized to provide a visually appealing design, with elements such as a background image, gradient overlays, rounded corners, and custom-sized input fields.

The project demonstrates a strong understanding of fundamental web development concepts, and showcases skills in creating an interactive, user-focused design. It serves as a practical application of HTML and CSS, offering a real-world scenario where these technologies can be used to gather and manage data.

This project provides a valuable contribution to the discourse around space exploration, by offering a platform for users to share their views and suggestions. The data gathered from this form could potentially offer insights that contribute to the planning and execution of future Mars missions.
